# Kiwihacks Podium

Peer-judging platform for Kiwihacks hackathons.
Forked from [Hack Club's Podium](https://github.com/hackclub/podium)
## How It Works

1. **Sign in** — Magic link authentication
2. **Select your event** — Choose from official Kiwihacks events
3. **Submit your project** — Add name, repo, demo URL
4. **Get validated** — itch.io demos checked for browser playability
5. **Vote** — Browse other projects and vote for your favorites

## For Organizers

Events are pre-created by admins (not users). Use `backend/scripts/manage.py` or NocoDB to manage events.

See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for system details.

## Development

```bash
# Start Postgres
docker compose up -d

# Backend
cd backend && doppler run --config dev -- uv run alembic upgrade head
cd backend && doppler run --config dev -- uv run podium

# Frontend (separate terminal)
cd frontend && bun dev
```

See [docs/local-dev.md](docs/local-dev.md) for full setup and [docs/kiwihacks-ops.md](docs/kiwihacks-ops.md) for deployment/runbook notes.
